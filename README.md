# Mission_to_Mars

### Overview
Throughout Module 11 we have helped Robin with Web-scraping techniques. In this assignment we will utilize Splinter, and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to work on these techniques, with a little bit more depth. From there, we will continue to use other skills we have learned in this course in order to wrangle, visualize, and analyze the data. 
### Deliverables
This new assignment consists of two technical products:
* Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
* Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
* Additionally a .csv file will be created in the second deliverable
### Resources
* DataSource(s): [Mars News](https://redplanetscience.com) for Deliverable 1 and [Mars Temperature Data](https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html) for deliverable 2.
* Software: Python 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook.
